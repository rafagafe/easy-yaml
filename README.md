[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/rafagafe/easy-yaml.svg?branch=main)](https://app.travis-ci.com/rafagafe/easy-yaml)

The easy-yaml parses YAML files and generates a tree of linked nodes.
Navigating or querying this tree is very easy using the provided API.
This module uses [LIBYAML](https://github.com/yaml/libyaml).
